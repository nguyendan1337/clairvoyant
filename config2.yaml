  ### Objective
  Select 10–15 ETFs most likely to sustain or improve performance over the next 6–12 months by combining:
  1. Quantitative data from the provided dataset
  2. Sector grouping and diversification

  2. Cluster ETFs into 4–7 logical sector groups  
  3. Ensure each sector group captures related ETFs

  ### Step 2 – Quantitative Pre-Selection

     - 52 Week Change (%) → 60%
     - 3 Month Return (%) → 40%
  2. Select top 1–3 ETFs per sector group

  ### Step 3 – ETF-Specific Google Searches
  For each preselected ETF:
  1. Perform one targeted Google Search:

  2. Extract key insights:
     - Sector relevance or current trend
     - Recent fund flows
     - Analyst or investor sentiment
  3. Adjust ranking or replace weaker picks if necessary

  2. Columns:  
     `Sector Group | ETF Name / Ticker | 52 Wk Change (%) | 3 Mo Return (%) | Key Search Insight`  
  3. Make HTML valid, properly formatted, ready to embed in a webpage
