  <h2>Market Chat:</h2>
  <p>Hey everyone, let's catch up on what's driving the markets! It's been a dynamic period, with investors navigating shifting tides. The US Fed recently trimmed its benchmark rate to 3.75%-4%, the lowest since late 2022, signaling a cautious approach even as some are paring back expectations for further quick cuts. Over in the Eurozone, inflation is cooling off, and the ECB is holding rates steady, suggesting a period of assessment for central banks globally.</p>

  <p>On the tech front, the **Innovation & AI / Robotics** sector is absolutely buzzing! We're seeing Samsung and NVIDIA team up to build an "AI factory," which is a huge step in AI-driven semiconductor manufacturing. This kind of collaboration, along with the rising excitement around humanoid robotics, shows that the AI race is heating up, creating strong tailwinds for ETFs like ARKQ and QTUM. Think about the impact of new chip partnerships and automation on productivity across so many industries!</p>

  <p>**Clean Energy & EV/Batteries** are also in the spotlight, with global investment hitting a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025. Despite a recent dip in utility-scale solar and onshore wind financing, especially in the US as policy landscapes adapt, the long-term outlook remains bright. The EU is also making big strides towards its 2030 climate goals, and small-scale solar is driving growth in emerging markets. This ongoing momentum underscores the opportunity in funds like CNRG and PBW.</p>

  <p>In the **Precious & Strategic Metals** space, things are looking interesting. Global military spending surged by 9.4% in 2024, the highest ever recorded, reflecting heightened geopolitical tensions. This backdrop often boosts demand for safe-haven assets, and we're seeing continued government interest in nuclear energy as a long-term solution, which is positive for uranium funds like URA and NLR. Gold explorers, represented by GOEX, are also shining as investors seek tangible assets in uncertain times.</p>

  <p>Finally, **Semiconductors** and **Emerging Markets** are truly standing out. SMH and FTXL continue to benefit from the insatiable demand for AI chips, with SMH seeing massive inflows of $3 billion over the last three months. The talk of semiconductors being the "new oil" certainly highlights their strategic importance. Meanwhile, South Korea's EWY is showing a fantastic comeback, up around 35% year-to-date, thanks to easing political uncertainty and local tech giants like SK Hynix riding the AI wave. It's definitely a market where carefully selected innovation and strategic exposure can pay off!</p>

<h2>How ETFs Were Selected</h2>
<p>
    Raw lists of ETFs were gathered compiled from multiple Yahoo Finance top performance lists. ETFs with leveraged or otherwise risky keywords were filtered out. Only those with a 52-week change above 25%, a 3-month return above 6%, and prices above both their 50-day and 200-day averages were kept. This indicates short, mid, and long term growth and momentum. The list was then sorted by 52 Week Change % to put the absolute best winners at the top. Finally, the list was given to Google Gemini which performed individual searches on those ETFs as well as searches for recent news and real world context to then come up with the final selection of 10-15 picks.
